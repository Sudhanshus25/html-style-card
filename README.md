# HTML Card
It is a user interface component commonly used in web development to display information in a visually appealing and organized manner. 
<br>
It is used to present information on a webpage, making them a popular choice for displaying items such as product listings, blog posts, portfolio items, and more.

In this if you will hover over the <b>'Read more'</b> button the color will get darker. 
For this I have used <b>'::hover'</b> property to change color of the button on mouse hover.
